\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
The project was globally a success. The team as a whole had the opportunity to use tools that allowed us to streamline our work quite effectively. As some members were more familiar than others on a particular tool or technology, communication was essential. We relied heavily on bitbucket.org to store code, track and assign issues to each other. An post-meeting email was systematically sent with the key decisions for everyone to archive, even when all team members were physically present at the meeting.

\paragraph{}
The final sprints were conducted when all team members were physically separated in locations that spanned 6 different timezones (from the East Coast to Poland). This proves that while distance certainly can hinder efficiency, remote development teams can still function well. Correct and up-to-date commit messages, distributed version control, and frequent communication were key to overcoming glitches and ensuring our success.
