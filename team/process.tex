\section{Development Process}

We used the scrum development cycle to structure our project.
This meant dividing the work into a series of \emph{sprints}, which each lasted approximately half a week.
Usually sprint lengths are in the order of weeks, but there was a short time to complete this project, and so short iterations were essential to a timely conclusion.

Each sprint was started with a meeting: either physical, or after the end of term, electronic.
In this meeting we reviewed the progress of the tasks of the previous sprint, deciding what could be released, and what must roll over to the next sprint.
Following the release of the previous sprint, we decided the present sprint's deadline, and discussed tasks which need doing.
Tasks were then allocated, first by preference, and then arbitrarily.
