\section{Responsibilities}

As discussed above, each team member assumed an equal role within the group, and we all had a joint responsibility complete the project on time.
This translated into a responsibility to complete our tasks on time and to the best of our ability, and to take an active role in scrum meetings.
Meetings were crucial to the success of the project: ensuring that the right tasks were set and allocated to the right members, as well as ensuring that the deadlines were both feasible and on track for the project submission deadline.
